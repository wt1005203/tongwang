I am a physicist by training, having earned my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2021. [My doctoral thesis](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/118639), supervised by [Prof. Sergei Maslov](https://maslov.bioengineering.illinois.edu/), focused on how microbial interactions, such as cross-feeding and predator-prey interactions, impact the **ecological and evolutionary dynamics of microbial communities**.

Currently, my research endeavors to **merge ecological theories and omics data** to decode the organizing principles of microbial communities, with a special interest in human gut microbiomes. In addition to theoretical modeling, I actively engage in **computational projects aimed at precision nutrition**. This includes developing models that predict metabolomic profiles by integrating microbial compositions and dietary information, employing both ecology-based and machine-learning approaches.

For a deeper dive into my professional journey and accomplishments, feel free to view my [CV](./TongWang_CV.pdf).

<!-- I am a physicist by training and received my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2021, with my thesis supervised by [Prof. Sergei Maslov](https://maslov.bioengineering.illinois.edu/). During my Ph.D. period, I focus on modeling microbial communities with cross-feeding and predator-prey interactions. The primary goal of my current research is to combine ecological models and omics data to reveal the assembly rules of microbial communities, especially the human gut microbiomes. Besides the mathematical modeling, I am intensively working on computational projects related to precision nutrition such as predicting metabolomic profiles based on microbial compositions and dietary information using ecology-based models and machine learning models. More information about me can be found in my [CV](./TongWang_CV.pdf). \-->
