I am a physicist by training, having earned my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2021. [My doctoral thesis](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/118639), supervised by [Prof. Sergei Maslov](https://maslov.bioengineering.illinois.edu/), focused on how microbial interactions, such as cross-feeding and predator-prey interactions, impact the **ecological and evolutionary dynamics of microbial communities**.

During my postdoctoral training at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, working under the supervision of [Prof. Yang-Yu Liu](https://yangyuliu.bwh.harvard.edu/), my research endeavors to **merge ecological theories and omics data** to decode the organizing principles of microbial communities, with a special interest in human gut microbiomes. In addition to theoretical modeling, I actively engage in developing **deep-learning methods caimed at precision nutrition**.

Currently, our research group is focused on uncovering the **intricate interactions among diet, microbes, metabolites, and the host** through a combination of computational and experimental approaches. On the computational side, we analyze multi-omics datasets, model the ecological dynamics of microbiomes, and develop machine learning tools. Experimentally, we use microbial cultures to validate computationally inferred interactions and to design novel therapeutic strategies based on synthetic microbial communities.

<!-- I am a physicist by training and received my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2021, with my thesis supervised by [Prof. Sergei Maslov](https://maslov.bioengineering.illinois.edu/). During my Ph.D. period, I focus on modeling microbial communities with cross-feeding and predator-prey interactions. The primary goal of my current research is to combine ecological models and omics data to reveal the assembly rules of microbial communities, especially the human gut microbiomes. Besides the mathematical modeling, I am intensively working on computational projects related to precision nutrition such as predicting metabolomic profiles based on microbial compositions and dietary information using ecology-based models and machine learning models. More information about me can be found in my [CV](./TongWang_CV.pdf). \-->
