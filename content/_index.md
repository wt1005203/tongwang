I am currently a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biological Sciences at Purdue University](https://www.bio.purdue.edu/People/profile/wang7403.html), where my research lies at the dynamic intersection of computational biology, microbiology, and ecology. I develop both mechanistic models and machine-learning methods to address **complex problems in microbial communities**. My work focuses on uncovering the intricate **interactions between diet, microbes, metabolites, and the host**. By modeling microbial ecosystems and integrating diverse multi-omics datasets, I aim to reveal the mechanisms that shape these communities and their critical roles in human health.

We are actively recruiting on both the computational and experimental sides of our research. If you are interested in joining the lab as a PhD student, postdoctoral researcher, or lab technician, please reach out to me at wang7403@purdue.edu.

<!-- % I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, working under the supervision of [Prof. Yang-Yu Liu](https://yangyuliu.bwh.harvard.edu/). My work is at the exciting **intersection of computational biology, microbiology, and ecology**, where I develop both mechanistic models and machine-learning methods to tackle **complex problems related to microbial communities**. My primary focus is to explore the intricate **relationships between diet, microbiome, metabolites, and disease**. By modeling these microbial ecosystems and integrating diverse omics data, I aim to unravel the complex dynamics of these communities and their pivotal roles in human health.-->

<!--I am a physicist by training and received my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2021, with my thesis focusing on modeling microbial communities with cross-feeding and predator-prey interactions. The primary goal of my current research is to combine ecological models and omics data to reveal the assembly rules of microbial communities, especially the human gut microbiomes. Besides the mathematical modeling, I am intensively working on computational projects related to precision nutrition such as predicting metabolomic profiles based on microbial compositions and dietary information using ecology-based models and machine learning models. More information about me can be found in my [CV](/files/TongWang_CV.pdf).-->
