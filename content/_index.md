I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at [Yang-Yu Liu’s](https://scholar.harvard.edu/yyl) lab at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. I am interested in developing mechanistic models and machine learning methods for solving problems in microbial communities.

<!--I am a physicist by training and received my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2021, with my thesis focusing on modeling microbial communities with cross-feeding and predator-prey interactions. The primary goal of my current research is to combine ecological models and omics data to reveal the assembly rules of microbial communities, especially the human gut microbiomes. Besides the mathematical modeling, I am intensively working on computational projects related to precision nutrition such as predicting metabolomic profiles based on microbial compositions and dietary information using ecology-based models and machine learning models. More information about me can be found in my [CV](/files/TongWang_CV.pdf).-->
